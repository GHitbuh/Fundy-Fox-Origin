# Fundy-Fox-Origin
A kitsune origin inspired by Fundy from the OriginsSMP.

## Features

* You are 80% of normal height (UPDATE: you can fit underneath slabs as well as go above slabs)
* You run faster at night, but you're slower during the day.
* By pressing the primary origin key (default G), you can crouch to go invisibile, but armour shows.
* By pressing the secondary origin key (default unbound), you can pounce.
* You get hungry quicker.
* Berries are much better of a food source for you.
* You get night vision when not in water.
* You don't take fall damage.
* You can't hold a shield.
